# 1  The alphabet.  
It is worth learning, it is slightly different and learning it may save a bit of confusion later on. There are dozens of sites that will explain it for example [this one](https://www.berlitz.com/blog/italian-alphabet) 
* it has fewer letters than the English alphabet 🏄
* but extra letters are included because of the entry of foreign words into italan 🃏
 * these are:
   - j ( ee loon-gah )
   - k ( kappa )
   - x ( eeks )
   - y ( ipsilon/ee greca )
