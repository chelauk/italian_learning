# 1   The alphabet.  
It is worth learning, it is slightly different and learning it may save a bit of confusion later on. There are dozens of sites that will explain it, for example [this one](https://www.berlitz.com/blog/italian-alphabet) 
* it has fewer letters than the English alphabet 🏄
* but extra letters are included because of the entry of foreign words into italan 🃏
 * these are:
 
   - j ( ee loon-gah )
   - k ( kappa )
   - x ( eeks )
   - y ( ipsilon/ee greca )

# 2  Numbers.
This should be easy and maybe it is just me but after ten I always forget 🃏 when to switch from 'ten after' eg: undici to 'ten before' eg: diciannove


  - undici
  - dodici
  - tredici
  - quattordici
  - quindici
  - sedici
  - diciassette  <<<< there's the switch! one day I will get it right 😆
  - diciotto
  - diciannove

# 3  Subject Pronouns.
I know that grammatical terms like "subject pronoun" can be off-putting but they are simply shorthand for a long description.  I will endevour to give a description of the term as soon as I used it and then go on touse the term.  The subject pronoun refers to the 'doer' in a sentence with a verb (a 'doing' word).  They are generally unecessary because the verb endings will tell you who the subject is but 🃏 they can be used to add emphasis or clarification. With regard to using the 'person' terminology it is yet another grammatical term but I hope it is clear.

these are the subject pronouns 🏄

| subject pronoun | person | translation |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|io| first person singular | I |
|tu | second person singular |You|
|lui/lei| third person |he/her/it |
|noi | first person plural | We |
|voi | second person plural | You ( plural )|
|loro | third person plural |they|

🃏 what I got stuck on for a while is that there is no 'it' subject pronoun in italian. When, say the dog, did something we use would use **lui** (to stand for il cane). I guess we would be perfectly comfortable doing this with pets but it also applies to inanimate objects. 

For example:

"The tree grew through the roof. Yes! It grew through the roof."
"L'albero è cresciuto attraverso il tetto. Sì! È lui cresciuto attraverso il tetto."

In this translation, the pronoun "lui" is used to emphasize the subject, "the tree" in this case.
