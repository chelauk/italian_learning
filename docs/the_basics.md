# 1   The alphabet.  
It is worth learning, it is slightly different and learning it may save a bit of confusion later on. There are dozens of sites that will explain it for example [this one](https://www.berlitz.com/blog/italian-alphabet) 
* it has fewer letters than the English alphabet 🏄
* but extra letters are included because of the entry of foreign words into italan 🃏
 * these are:
 
   - j ( ee loon-gah )
   - k ( kappa )
   - x ( eeks )
   - y ( ipsilon/ee greca )

# 2  Numbers.
This should be easy and maybe it is just me but after ten I always forget 🃏 when to switch from 'ten after' eg: undici to 'ten before' eg :dicianove


  - undici
  - dodici
  - tredici
  - quattordici
  - quindici
  - sedici
  - diciassette  <<<< there's the switch! one day I will get it right 😆
  - diciotto
  - diciannove
