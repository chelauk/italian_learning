I am a native English speaker attempting to learn Italian. I enjoy the process of language learning and I am interested at a very amateur level in linguistics and language.

I intend this to accompany the learning process, it is neither complete nor sufficient for italian language learning, instead I want to flag the pitfalls I fell into and help people through them.

I will mark the rule with this symbol :surfer:
I will mark the pitfalls with this symbol :black_joker:
